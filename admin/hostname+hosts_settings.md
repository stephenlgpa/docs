# Settings to my Hostname and Hosts

These settings have worked to properly apply a new hostname to my system.

## /etc/hostname

`mail@pronkingantelope.work`

You can use any name in front of `@`. It doesn't matter. But because I am using a mail server on the system, it makes sense to call it `mail`.

## /etc/hosts

```
127.0.0.1 localhost localhost
206.189.40.192 mail.pronkingantelope.work
```

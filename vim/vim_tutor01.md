# A New File

This is a new file produced in VIM.

I recall once learning to use this, but it seemed so strange that I didn't continue. Perhaps there was really no reason. I was probably taken with the idea that it was "free" software, closer to a minimalist ideal than visual editors. But "visual" editors, well what are we talking about? Word? I have moved to plain text files anyway in recent years, preferring Markdown to visual editing. (Of course if I were editing for a styled medium, such as academic publication, then I would use a visual editor). Most of what I do only requires the simple editing Markdown supplies.

> But I do love the simplicity of text. (Not that VIM is simple, god no! It really does hark back to a time where the simplicity of plain text hid the complexity of the editors designed to manipulate it). A visual system with mouse support is superior for easy text editing, but a person who knows their VIM is probably faster!.

That is the end of my rant.
